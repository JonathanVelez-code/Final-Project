						Jordan B. Peterson is a renowned author and clinical psychologist.
						He decides to return to the public light after being gone for two years by releasing his new book Beyond Order. 
						Explaining his hiatus to a near-death experience struggling with an addiction to benzodiazepines.
						He described himself being put in a medically induced coma in Russia for his rehabilitation.
						Peterson intended to release Beyond Order years ago but couldn’t because of life compilations.

					</p>
					<p>
						Beyond Order is a continuation of the series 12 Rules for Life.
						Almost all of this idea is taken from his book Map of Meaning, a comprehensive theory about how people construct meaning, form beliefs, and make narratives.
						The book, which took Peterson 13 years to complete, draws concepts from various fields, including mythology, religion, literature, philosophy, and psychology, following the modern scientific understanding of how the brain functions.
						This leads him to create a simplified version for the public on putting his comprehensive theory in practice with the form of rules.
					</p>
					<p>
						The main focus for both books within the series is predicated on the notion that chaos and order are beneficial to live a meaningful life with the understanding to much of either can lead to human suffering or withdrawal from life.
						However, 12 Rules for Life focus on the dangers of an excess of chaos by providing life advice to bring order.
						Therefore Beyond Order is more concerned about the risks of too much structure by giving life advice to attack chaos.
						12 Rules for Life has been heavily criticized for its simplistic nature, leading to simple conclusions.
						Thought being true, it might have been the book's intended purpose, which revolves around the idea of order/structure.
						After all, the intended meaning is more evident when it comes to Beyond Order, which focuses more on the ideas presented than rules.
					</p>
					<p>
						Peterson brings up many viewpoints with each chapter, which can be interrelated by pinpointing the main theme that will hinder his work.
						Even the title suggests that there “rules for life,” but each chapter can be interpreted on many levels.
						From a basic level, one can interpret the main point that humans derive meaning in life from sacrifices when envisioning and achieving goals from a state of the unknown.
						He described the unknown as things that we are afraid of doing or avoiding by living a life of complacency when not pursuing the unknown.
						He explains other perspectives on how individuals do not reach their full potential. For example, Constraining ideologies that inhibit you from seeing another path towards success is detrimental.
						He criticizes and gives an alternative opinion to the famous thinker Friedrich Nietzsche who believed in creating your belief systems to become an Übermensch (superhuman).
						Peterson argues that:
					</p>
					<blockquote>There is little evidence that any of us have the genius to create ourselves ex nihilo —from nothing—particularly given the extreme limitations of our experience, the biases of our perceptions, and the short span of our lives.</blockquote> 
					<p>
						Peterson suggests instead find belief systems from already established ideologies and be selective to ideas.
						Jordan emphasizes you must abandon new or old ideas to become a better human being.
						Most of the book's tone focuses on the importance of time, human suffering, and unreached potential, which is all-encompassing chaos.

					</p>

					<p>
						The book is a double-edged sword that has a large number of ideas but at the same time is left for interpretation.
						However, assuming everything was literal, the given twelve rules are helpful.
						For example, rule seven, “Work as hard as you possibly can on at least one thing and see what happens,” was one of the motivating factors for doing this review to the best of my ability.
						I was impressed with the chapter illustration that takes the form of tarot cards.
						Each chapter has significant meaning to each card, showing how creative and well-planned to create a state of perception inception.
						I found myself think hours after reading each chapter to see another viewpoint that put me in a loop of deconstructing.
						However, compared to 12 Rules for Life, I found it hard to read entirely because of its simplicity, making it a lackluster experience.
						Some rules were similar in concept to his previous twelve rules but might have intended to be interrelated because it is going beyond the order.
					</p>
					<p>
						The overarching question is, who should read Beyond Order? I would include everyone who enjoys Peterson’s style of write and familiar with his work.
						Fans who enjoyed 12 Rules for Life and want to see how the series concludes.
						Individuals who wish to learn something new without prior exposure to Peterson’s work.
						However, those who shouldn’t read his book would include people that don’t like biblical references and scriptures—also, Individuals who oppose Jordan’s beliefs because of political differences.
						I'm sure Beyond order will be impactful for people who are struggling with the meaning of life.
						My biggest concern for Beyond Order is the rules or idea because they aren’t hidden revelations that exclusively Peterson has found.
						I would even suggest most of the rules are in Principle by Ray Dalio, but the deliberation in Beyond Order makes sure the ideas are ingrained, which I found with other books that give life advice to be brushed off within a matter of days.
